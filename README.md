# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Description

This project was developed as part of Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course, serving as the culmination of the Front-End Development Track.

The website highlights the implementation of a booking application integrated into the Little Lemon Website. Employing React Components, it demonstrates a proficiency in utilizing React for website creation, including the incorporation of API calls.

It's important to note that, aside from the design, the only operational functionality on this website is the "Reserve a Table" feature.
